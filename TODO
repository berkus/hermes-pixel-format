!! NOTE - This is a stable release. If you want newer features that are
   listed down there or even things that aren't listed, try the development
   version, although that is unsupported !!

Update: Nothing is being added to this TODO list. The stable releases are
in maintenance mode, i.e. bugfixing and new converters are being added
as they are written + support for new compilers. But no API changes as there
are too many library dependencies to break.

All work goes into the development release and some of it is being fed back
in here.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, with the rewrite there are a few things to do (in order of priority):

DONE - Implement more stretch converters. If anyone wants to offer help,
      please get in touch. It's not a hard job..
      In particular, stretch converters for generic routines. The percentage
      on the left shows how many converters are done in total. Note that
      it is only so low because of stretch converters. Normal converters
      exist for all formats. At the time of writing this, 106 / 144
      converters have been written.

DONE - Stretch converters for generic formats

DONE- Incorporate Visual C support (that means write a Makefile.. and force
      stack calling) 

5%  - Speed up generic converters

5%? - Assembler stretching

    - Implement more dithering (and dithered stretching :)
