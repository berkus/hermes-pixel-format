The files in this directory are used by the author to test various things
at various time. Feel free to use them for your own enjoyment but no 
guarantees that they will work.

Rephrased.. They are UNSUPPORTED :) Some of them require C++ as well!

By the way, you will need the following (and they're hardcoded in the
Makefile):
	- X SHM extension
	- hermes compiled properly and positioned in ../src/.libs
	- X11 libraries in /usr/X11R6/lib
	- Electric Fence

If you're more interested, this is what each of the files test:
	
	- CheckLeaks.c: This is supposed to return 0 at the end if there
	are no memory leaks. It returns 32 at the moment.. :) Anyway, this
	uses highly platform specific code.. so it might not compiled if
	you don't use Linux.

	- Test.c: This is to test conversion from 32 bit rgb888 to whatever
	you like. 16 bit rgb 565 is hardcoded. It displays a couple of
	strips in different colours.

	- TestPalette.c: Same as test, but from an indexed mode to a target.
	Displays no strips but curve-like thingies..

	- Request.c: Benchmark the converter request routine.

	- Efence.cc: Checks the most frequently used converters for
	boundary violations using electric fence. This takes ages so
	be prepared to wait.
