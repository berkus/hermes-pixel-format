Pleaserefer to the included file COPYING.LIB for the exact terms.----------------------------------------------------------------------------This file is to explain how to compile Hermes in DOS.	1. Watcom	2. DJGPP1. WatcomWith Watcom, you get a choice between compiling with assembler support andwithout. First, cd into the source directory:        cd SRCThen, depending on whether you want assembler support (you need NASM installedfor this, look into README on where to get it), type either:        wmake -f MAKEFILE.WAT asm=yes  (with assembler)        wmake -f MAKEFILE.WAT          (without assembler)When it is finished, you will hopefully have a library called HERMES.LIB.Copy it to your favourite library repository. Also, copy all the headerfiles to your favourite header file repository.Have fun using Hermes :) (You can delete the distribution now that it isinstalled)2. DJGPPYou need NASM to install Hermes using DJGPP at the moment. Look into READMEfor details on where to get it.As soon as you have NASM installed, cd into the SRC\ directory and type        make -f MAKEFILE.DJThat's it, watch it being built. When you are finished, there will be alibrary called HERMES.A. Copy that to your library directory. Then copyall the header files (*.h) into your include directory.That's it, you can delete Hermes again, you've installed it.
